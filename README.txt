min cut == max flow.

here our assumption is the the graph when the minimum flow edges is and we remove all the edges and it produces the partition. means they are in the critical paths. they provide the bottle neck in the graph.

procedure to find all those edges :
find paths and substract the mini edge from all the flow.
find next and subsequently.



application : 

base ball/cricket/call out.
